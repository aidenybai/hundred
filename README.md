# ðŸª¶ `tiny-vdom`

### Hyper-lightweight Virtual DOM

`tiny-vdom` is intended to be the most lightweight virtual DOM implementation, and is a proof-of-concept and a learning resource more than a tool you should actually use in production.

Additionally, just because `tiny-vdom` is lightweight doesn't mean it's performant by any means. It is faster and smaller than [`simple-virtual-dom`](https://github.com/livoras/simple-virtual-dom), but ranks behind [production-ready Virtual DOM libraries](https://million.js.org/benchmarks/official-benchmarks)
